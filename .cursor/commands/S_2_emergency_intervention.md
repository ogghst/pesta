EMERGENCY STOP AND RESET

Something has gone wrong. Let's diagnose and recover:

1. IMMEDIATE ASSESSMENT
   - What was the last successful state?
   - What changed that caused the issue?
   - What's currently broken?

2. ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
   - What was the triggering action or change?
   - What assumptions proved incorrect?
   - What context or information was missing?

3. RECOVERY OPTIONS
   Option A: Rollback
   - Revert to last known good state
   - What do we lose?

   Option B: Fix Forward
   - What needs to change?
   - How many steps to recovery?

   Option C: Replanning
   - Should we restart with new approach?
   - What do we know now that we didn't before?

4. PREVENTION STRATEGY
   - How do we avoid this in the future?
   - What early warning signs did we miss?
   - What guardrails should we add?

Recommend the best recovery path with clear next steps.
