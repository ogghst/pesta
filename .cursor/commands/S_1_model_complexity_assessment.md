MODEL COMPLEXITY ASSESSMENT

Analyze this task to determine appropriate model selection:

1. TASK COMPLEXITY SCORING
   Rate each dimension (1-5, where 5 is most complex):
   - Architectural reasoning required: [1-5]
   - Ambiguity in requirements: [1-5]
   - Codebase context needed: [1-5]
   - Novel problem (vs. pattern replication): [1-5]
   - Risk/criticality level: [1-5]

2. PHASE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
   For each PDCA phase, recommend model tier:
   - Plan (Analysis): [high/medium/low capability model]
   - Plan (Detailed): [high/medium/low capability model]
   - Do (Implementation): [high/medium/low capability model]
   - Check (Review): [high/medium/low capability model]
   - Act (Retrospective): [high/medium/low capability model]

3. JUSTIFICATION
   Explain reasoning for recommendations:
   - Where does high capability add value?
   - Where can lower capability suffice?
   - What are the cost/quality tradeoffs?

4. DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS
   What signs indicate we should switch to a higher capability model:
   - [list specific failure modes]
   
Provide your assessment and recommendations.
