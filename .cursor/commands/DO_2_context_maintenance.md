CONTEXT CHECK AND RESET

We've been working for [X minutes/steps]. Let's verify we're still on track:

1. CURRENT STATE SUMMARY
   - What have we completed so far?
   - What tests are passing?
   - What files have been modified?

2. PLAN ALIGNMENT CHECK
   - Are we following the original plan?
   - Have we deviated, and if so, why?
   - Should we adjust the plan based on what we've learned?

3. CONTEXT DRIFT DETECTION
   Review recent changes for these warning signs:
   - Code duplication appearing
   - Ignoring established patterns
   - Going off on tangents from the main objective
   - Increasing complexity without clear benefit

4. NEXT STEP CONFIRMATION
   - What's the next step from our plan?
   - What test needs to fail first?
   - What's our exit criteria for this step?

Provide a brief status report before continuing.
