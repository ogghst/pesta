QUALITY METRICS ASSESSMENT

Evaluate the changes against these quality indicators:

1. COMMIT METRICS
   - Lines changed: [count] (target: < 100)
   - Files touched: [count] (target: < 5)
   - Test coverage: [production files with corresponding test changes]
   - Complexity introduced: [low/medium/high]

2. CODE HEALTH INDICATORS
   - Duplicated code blocks: [none/minimal/concerning]
   - Cyclomatic complexity: [simple/moderate/complex]
   - Coupling: [loose/moderate/tight]
   - Cohesion: [high/moderate/low]

3. TEST QUALITY
   - Test types: [unit/integration/e2e counts]
   - Coverage of edge cases: [comprehensive/adequate/insufficient]
   - Test readability: [clear/acceptable/confusing]
   - Test independence: [isolated/some dependencies/tightly coupled]

4. ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT
   - Pattern consistency: [maintains/extends/breaks existing patterns]
   - Abstraction appropriateness: [right level/over-abstracted/under-abstracted]
   - Technical debt: [reduced/neutral/increased]

IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:
- List 2-3 areas where quality could be enhanced
- Note any technical debt to address in future iterations
