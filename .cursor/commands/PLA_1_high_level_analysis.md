ANALYSIS PHASE: Business Problem and Technical Approach

Ask the user over the Objective if not clear

REQUIRED DELIVERABLES BEFORE PROCEEDING:

1. CODEBASE PATTERN ANALYSIS
   - Search the codebase and identify 2-3 existing implementations that follow similar patterns
   - Document which namespaces, interfaces, and base classes are involved
   - List any established architectural layers we should respect

2. INTEGRATION TOUCHPOINT MAPPING
   - Identify which existing methods, classes, or modules will need modification
   - Document any system dependencies or external integrations
   - Map configuration patterns (where settings are stored and how they're loaded)

3. ABSTRACTION INVENTORY
   - List existing abstractions that could be leveraged (interfaces, base classes, utility functions)
   - Identify any patterns for dependency injection, service location, or factory methods
   - Note any existing test utilities or fixtures we can reuse

4. ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
   - Propose at least 2-3 different technical approaches to solve this problem
   - For each approach, outline:
     * Pros and cons
     * Alignment with existing architecture
     * Estimated complexity
     * Risk factors

5. ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT
   - What architectural principles does this solution follow or violate?
   - Where might this create future maintenance burden?
   - What are the testing challenges?

OUTPUT CONSTRAINTS:
- Focus on "what" and "why" rather than implementation details
- Keep analysis human-readable and concise
- Flag any ambiguities or missing information
- Identify risks and unknown factors

After you provide the analysis, wait for my feedback before proceeding to detailed planning.
