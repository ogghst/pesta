# SPECIFICATION-FIRST PLANNING

Create a detailed specification that will guide our implementation:

1. FEATURE SPECIFICATION
   - User-facing description: What will users be able to do?
   - Success criteria: How do we know this feature works correctly?
   - Edge cases: What unusual scenarios must we handle?
   - Error conditions: What can go wrong and how should we respond?

2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
   - Interfaces to create or modify
   - Data structures required
   - Integration points with existing code
   - Configuration or settings needed
   - Security considerations

3. TASK BREAKDOWN
   Break the specification into actionable, testable tasks:
   - Each task should be completable in 15-30 minutes
   - Tasks must have clear done criteria
   - Tasks should be ordered by dependency
   - Mark tasks as [UNIT], [INTEGRATION], or [E2E] based on test type

4. RISK ASSESSMENT
   - High risk areas requiring extra attention
   - Dependencies on external systems or APIs
   - Performance considerations
   - Backward compatibility requirements

Record your plan in [plans](/docs/plans/) folder

This specification will serve as our contract and documentation

tag the analysis with a 6 digit code and store in [analysis](/docs/analysis/) folder. wait for my feedback before proceeding to detailed planning.
