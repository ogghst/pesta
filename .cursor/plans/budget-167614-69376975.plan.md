# Budget Timeline Update Plan

## Summary

Implement always-on display of budget, cost, and absolute earned value in the timeline components, removing the display mode toggle and updating supporting utilities and visuals accordingly.

## Steps

1. remove-display-toggle — Remove display mode UI/state from `BudgetTimelineFilter` and parent routes (`projects.$id*`) so timelines no longer depend on user selection.
2. adjust-data-fetching — Update `BudgetTimeline` to fetch/show all three datasets by default, align dataset styling, and ensure tooltip shows cost/budget/earned value for every point.
3. refactor-earned-value — Modify `buildEarnedValueTimeline` (or alternative) to emit absolute values rather than cumulative totals, updating dependent code and tests.
4. add-tests — Add or update tests verifying earned value aggregation and chart dataset preparation to reflect the new behavior.

### To-dos

- [ ] Remove display mode toggle from filters and parent routes
- [ ] Update BudgetTimeline to always fetch and display budget, cost, and earned value with unified tooltip
- [ ] Refactor earned value aggregation to return absolute values and update consumers
- [ ] Add or update tests covering absolute earned value and chart dataset configuration
