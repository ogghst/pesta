# WORKING AGREEMENTS FOR THIS SESSION

I commit to the following quality standards for our collaboration:

## CORE PRINCIPLES

- Test-Driven Development (TDD): All code changes must be preceded by failing tests
- Incremental Change: Small, atomic commits that can be understood and reviewed independently
- Architectural Respect: Follow existing patterns and abstractions in the codebase
- No Code Duplication: Reuse existing implementations and abstractions

## INTERVENTION CHECKPOINTS

Before you proceed with any implementation, I will ask:

- "Where's the failing test first?"
- "Are you fixing multiple things? Focus on one failing test."
- "Does this follow the existing architectural patterns?"
- "Can we reuse an existing abstraction instead?"

## QUALITY GATES

- Maximum 100 lines changed per commit (target)
- Maximum 5 files touched per commit (target)
- Every commit modifying production code must also modify test files
- No compilation errors as "red phase" - only behavioral failures count

## MCP TOOLS TO USE

- get_current_time: to set current time in documents
- context7: to get insights on what libraries to use and guidelines for coding with them

Acknowledge these agreements and confirm your understanding.
