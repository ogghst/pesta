## Notes and Observations

### Recent Updates

- **2025-11-02:** ✅ **E1-004 COMPLETE!** Project Creation Interface implemented. Modal form with all 10 fields (required + optional). Status dropdown with 4 predefined values. Project Manager dropdown loads all active users. Full validation with React Hook Form. Toast notifications on success/error. Query invalidation refreshes projects list. Matches existing AddUser pattern perfectly.
- **2025-11-01:** ✅ **DOC-005 COMPLETE!** Development environment setup finalized. Environment scaffolded using ready-made template from FastAPI GitHub repository. Includes Docker Compose infrastructure, dependency management (uv for Python, npm for Node.js), CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions), pre-commit hooks, and comprehensive documentation. All development tools and workflows are configured and ready for use.
- **2025-11-01:** 🎉 **E1-001 COMPLETE!** Database schema implementation finished. All 19 models implemented including User/Item, lookup tables, core hierarchy (Project/WBE/CostElement), all EVM tracking models, change/quality management, and audit/compliance. 19 Alembic migrations applied successfully. 121/121 tests passing. Comprehensive test coverage with proper relationships. Clean model organization with SQLModel patterns. Foundation established for Sprint 1.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection updated to use SQLite for MVP (was PostgreSQL). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite for initial implementation with clear migration path to PostgreSQL for production. Comprehensive selection document updated.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection completed (DOC-004). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite (MVP). Comprehensive selection document created with rationale, architecture diagrams, and detailed component specifications.
- **2024-12-19:** Updated PRD and data model with Planned Value and Earned Value calculation requirements. Added Baseline Log table to replace boolean baseline flags with proper baseline_id references. All documentation is now complete and aligned.

### Design Decisions

- Technology stack: FastAPI (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL database
- **Model implementation approach:** Model-first with auto-generated Alembic migrations, using SQLModel throughout
- **TDD discipline:** Comprehensive test suite with 66 model tests covering relationships, validation, and schemas
- **Code organization:** Clean separation - 1 file per model with Base/Create/Update/Public schema pattern
- Baseline tracking uses centralized Baseline Log table instead of scattered boolean flags
- Planned Value calculation uses Cost Element Schedule with progression types (linear, gaussian, logarithmic)
- Earned Value calculation uses baselined percentage of work completed
- All baseline references use baseline_id for proper audit trail and historical tracking
- UUID primary keys throughout for scalability
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships with cascade deletes where appropriate

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** ✅ Database schema complete - Begin E1-005 (WBE Creation Interface)
2. **Short-term:** Build UI interfaces for WBE and Cost Element creation
3. **Medium-term:** Implement data validation rules and hierarchy integrity

## Retrospectives and Lessons Learned

This section captures key learnings from development sessions to prevent repeating mistakes and improve our workflow.

### Session: E1-004 Project Creation Interface (2025-11-02)

**Objective:** Implement project creation UI following existing patterns.

**What We Accomplished:**

- Created AddProject component following AddUser pattern perfectly
- Fixed EditUser.tsx TypeScript issue discovered during build
- Integrated component into projects page
- Rebuilt and deployed frontend successfully
- All validation and dropdowns working correctly

**Critical Moments:**

1. **TypeScript Error Discovery:** During first build, discovered pre-existing EditUser.tsx error that blocked compilation
   - **Significance:** Caught a latent bug that would have caused issues later
   - **Learning:** Always run full build/test cycle before claiming "no compilation errors"

2. **Docker Cache Issue:** Initial restart didn't load new frontend build
   - **Significance:** Wasted ~15 minutes debugging why button wasn't showing
   - **Learning:** Need to use `docker compose build --no-cache` or `up -d --force-recreate` to ensure fresh builds

3. **Pattern Following Success:** AddUser.tsx pattern worked perfectly with minimal adaptation
   - **Significance:** Validated architectural consistency approach
   - **Learning:** Existing patterns are battle-tested and should be followed religiously

**Collaboration Effectiveness:**

- **Most Effective:** User's clear clarifications (project manager: all users, status: dropdown)
- **Communication Gap:** User had to point out missing button - should have verified with screenshot earlier
- **Best Prompts:** High-level analysis followed by specific clarifications
- **Human Value:** Catching the missing UI element saved significant debugging time

**Wasted Effort:**

- Docker cache issues cost ~20 minutes
- Should have run `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` immediately after build
- Could have checked container filesystem earlier to verify new assets were loaded

**Process Improvements That Worked:**

- High-level analysis before implementation (PLA_1 pattern)
- Reusing AddUser.tsx as reference
- TypeScript strict checking caught issues early
- Working agreements (TDD mindset) kept focus on quality

**Process Improvements Needed:**

- Add Docker rebuild checklist to development workflow
- Include visual verification step in completion criteria
- Document common Docker cache gotchas

**Technical Insights:**

- Chakra UI Dialog pattern with DialogTrigger/DialogContent is consistent across codebase
- React Hook Form Controller needed for native select elements with null handling
- TanStack Query invalidateQueries pattern is established and reliable
- Docker layer caching can cause stale assets even after "successful" rebuilds

**Key Patterns to Remember:**

1. Modal forms: DialogRoot → DialogTrigger (Button) → DialogContent → Form
2. useQuery needs arrow function wrapper: `queryFn: () => Service.method()`
3. useMutation pattern: mutationFn → onSuccess (toast, reset, close) → onSettled (invalidate)
4. Status/project manager dropdowns use Controller with value={field.value || ""}

**Most Valuable Change for Next Session:**

**Docker Build Verification Checklist** to add to workflow:

```bash
After Docker build:
1. Run: docker compose up -d --force-recreate <service>
2. Verify: docker compose exec <service> ls <expected-files>
3. Check logs: docker compose logs <service> --tail=20
4. Hard refresh browser to clear cache
5. Take screenshot to verify UI changes
```

This would have prevented the Docker cache issue entirely.
