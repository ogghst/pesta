## Notes and Observations

### Recent Updates

- **2025-11-01:** ✅ **DOC-005 COMPLETE!** Development environment setup finalized. Environment scaffolded using ready-made template from FastAPI GitHub repository. Includes Docker Compose infrastructure, dependency management (uv for Python, npm for Node.js), CI/CD workflows (GitHub Actions), pre-commit hooks, and comprehensive documentation. All development tools and workflows are configured and ready for use.
- **2025-11-01:** 🎉 **E1-001 COMPLETE!** Database schema implementation finished. All 19 models implemented including User/Item, lookup tables, core hierarchy (Project/WBE/CostElement), all EVM tracking models, change/quality management, and audit/compliance. 19 Alembic migrations applied successfully. 121/121 tests passing. Comprehensive test coverage with proper relationships. Clean model organization with SQLModel patterns. Foundation established for Sprint 1.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection updated to use SQLite for MVP (was PostgreSQL). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite for initial implementation with clear migration path to PostgreSQL for production. Comprehensive selection document updated.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection completed (DOC-004). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite (MVP). Comprehensive selection document created with rationale, architecture diagrams, and detailed component specifications.
- **2024-12-19:** Updated PRD and data model with Planned Value and Earned Value calculation requirements. Added Baseline Log table to replace boolean baseline flags with proper baseline_id references. All documentation is now complete and aligned.

### Design Decisions

- Technology stack: FastAPI (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL database
- **Model implementation approach:** Model-first with auto-generated Alembic migrations, using SQLModel throughout
- **TDD discipline:** Comprehensive test suite with 66 model tests covering relationships, validation, and schemas
- **Code organization:** Clean separation - 1 file per model with Base/Create/Update/Public schema pattern
- Baseline tracking uses centralized Baseline Log table instead of scattered boolean flags
- Planned Value calculation uses Cost Element Schedule with progression types (linear, gaussian, logarithmic)
- Earned Value calculation uses baselined percentage of work completed
- All baseline references use baseline_id for proper audit trail and historical tracking
- UUID primary keys throughout for scalability
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships with cascade deletes where appropriate

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** ✅ Database schema complete - Begin E1-003 (Application Framework Setup)
2. **Short-term:** Implement CRUD API endpoints for core models (Project, WBE, CostElement)
3. **Medium-term:** Build UI interfaces for project hierarchy creation
