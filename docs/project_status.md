- **2025-11-16:** 📋 **E4-003 EVM Performance Indices – Detailed Plan Complete.** High-level analysis and detailed TDD implementation plan completed. Plan document: `docs/plans/e4-003-evm-performance-indices.plan.md`. **Business rules confirmed:** CPI undefined when AC = 0 and EV > 0; SPI null when PV = 0; TCPI returns 'overrun' when BAC ≤ AC; indices required at project and WBE levels. Implementation structured in 5 phases (service layer, models, API routes, registration, integration) with 13 steps total. Estimated 15-24 hours. Ready for implementation starting Phase 1 (TDD: failing tests first).
- **2025-11-14:** 📋 **PLA-2 Detailed Plan Approved.** Documented global time machine requirement covering header control, backend session persistence, and filtering. See `docs/plans/PLA_2_detailed_planning.md`. Implementation scheduled across Sprint 4 (backend) and Sprint 5 (UI/client propagation).
- **2025-11-15:** ✅ **PLA-1 Control-Date Filtering Complete.** Added shared `time_machine` helper module, enforced schedule cutoffs by both `registration_date` and `created_at` across budget timeline, planned value, cost element schedules, and baseline logs, and backfilled regression tests to cover late-created registrations. Documentation and plan checklist updated.
- **2025-11-13:** ✅ **PLA-1 Schedule Tab Migration Complete!** Cost element schedule CRUD operations moved from EditCostElement form to dedicated "Schedule" tab following CostRegistrationsTable pattern. Created CostElementSchedulesTable component with full history view, Add/Edit/Delete schedule components, and E2E test coverage. Schedule section completely removed from EditCostElement form. Timeline query invalidation added to all schedule, earned value, and cost registration CRUD operations ensuring timeline visualizations refresh automatically. Earned value color updated to green (#48bb78) in timeline charts per EVM standards. All tests passing (4/4 BudgetTimeline tests). Completion report: `docs/completions/pla_1_cost-element-schedule-tab-migration-completion.md`.

- **2025-11-12:** ✅ **Cost Element Schedule Documentation Refined.** Updated PRD, data model, and roadmap language to document schedule registration description/registration date requirements, newest-registration selection for live EVM, and baseline cloning rules ahead of implementation phase.

- **2025-11-10:** ✅ **E4-001 PLANNED VALUE ENGINE COMPLETE!** Added PV calculation service and `/projects/{project_id}/planned-value` APIs, persisted `planned_value` snapshots via migration `2f8c2a1ad8e3_add_planned_value_to_baseline_cost_element.py`, regenerated the SDK/UI to surface PV metrics, and verified `python -m pytest backend/tests/services/test_planned_value.py backend/tests/api/routes/test_planned_value.py` passes against local Postgres (`postgres/changethis@localhost:5432/app`).
- **2025-11-09:** ✅ **E3-007 BASELINE DECOUPLING COMPLETE!** Earned value entries no longer persist `baseline_id`; BaselineCostElement snapshots now capture both `percent_complete` and `earned_ev`, and baseline earned value UI reflects snapshot data. Backend migration `0f5f73e9f9ad_decouple_earned_value_baseline` deployed with regenerated API client and updated documentation.
- **2025-11-07:** ✅ **PLA-1 CODE CLEANUP COMPLETE!** Removed deprecated BaselineSnapshot model and dropped the table via migration `a8d41cd1b784_remove_baseline_snapshot_table`. Updated helper/tests to rely exclusively on `BaselineLog` and retained `BaselineSnapshotSummaryPublic` as a backwards-compatible alias. Next step: manual UI verification for baseline creation/summaries.
- **2025-11-07:** ✅ **E3-006 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Added backend `earned_value_entries` CRUD routes with schedule validation, percent range enforcement, duplicate date protection, and earned value derivation. Regenerated OpenAPI client and implemented Earned Value tab with add/edit/delete dialogs (percent preview, warning surfacing) on the cost element detail page. All 11 backend API tests, targeted Vitest spec, and TypeScript build passing.
- **2025-01-27:** ✅ **PLA-1 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot merge fully implemented. All 8 phases complete: Model updates (department/is_pmb fields added to BaselineLog), database migration (columns added + data migrated), helper function refactoring (create_baseline_cost_elements_for_baseline_log replaces create_baseline_snapshot_for_baseline_log), API endpoint updates (use BaselineLog directly, snapshot endpoint works without BaselineSnapshot), frontend component updates (ViewBaselineSnapshot → ViewBaseline, BaselineSnapshotSummary → BaselineSummary), API client regeneration (types updated), test updates (all route tests updated, verify BaselineSnapshot NOT created), deprecation (BaselineSnapshot marked as deprecated with TODO comments). **Result:** Unified baseline management system using BaselineLog only. BaselineSnapshot model kept for backward compatibility but marked deprecated. All tests passing, no regressions. Backward compatibility maintained (snapshot_id = baseline_id in API responses).
- **2025-11-05:** 📋 **PLA-1 DETAILED PLAN COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot merge detailed TDD implementation plan created at `docs/plans/pla_1_baseline-log-snapshot-merge-implementation.plan.md`.

Follows TDD approach with failing tests first, incremental commits (<100 lines, <5 files), and comprehensive test coverage. Estimated effort: 12-16 hours total (backend 8-10h, frontend 2-3h, testing 2-3h). Ready for implementation starting Phase 1 (TDD: failing tests first).
- **2025-11-05:** 📋 **PLA-1 HIGH-LEVEL ANALYSIS COMPLETE!** Baseline Log and Baseline Snapshot concept merge analysis completed. Analysis document created at `docs/analysis/pla_1_baseline-log-snapshot-merge-analysis.md`. Comprehensive analysis covers: current state (BaselineLog + BaselineSnapshot models with one-to-one relationship), codebase patterns (auto-creation, tabbed views, aggregation), integration touchpoints (backend models, API routes, frontend components), abstraction inventory, three alternative approaches (full merge recommended, read-only view, gradual deprecation), architectural impact assessment, risks and unknowns. **Recommendation:** Approach 1 - Full Merge (BaselineSnapshot into BaselineLog). Rationale: simplifies architecture, eliminates duplication, improves performance, consistent with codebase patterns. Estimated effort: 12-16 hours total (backend 8-10h, frontend 2-3h, testing 2-3h). Ready for detailed planning phase.
- **2025-11-04:** ✅ **E3-008 IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!** Baseline Snapshot View UI fully implemented and integrated. All 9 phases complete: 3 backend API endpoints (snapshot summary, cost elements by WBE, cost elements list), 4 frontend components (summary cards, grouped table with collapsible WBE sections, paginated flat table, modal with tabs), and ViewBaselineSnapshot integrated into BaselineLogsTable. Modal includes 3 tabs: Summary (project-level aggregated metrics), By WBE (grouped view - default tab), All Cost Elements (paginated flat list). Manual testing successful. Completion analysis saved at `docs/completions/e3-008-baseline-snapshot-view-ui-completion.md`. Known issue: Test cleanup order in conftest.py needs fix (separate infrastructure concern).
- **2025-11-09:** ✅ **Budget Timeline EV Overlay COMPLETE!** Frontend: `frontend/src/components/Projects/BudgetTimeline.tsx` now overlays Earned Value (EV) alongside Planned Value (PV) and Actual Cost (AC) using a new `buildEarnedValueTimeline` utility for daily cumulative aggregation. Filters redesigned with Chakra `Collapsible` sections in `BudgetTimelineFilter` to conserve vertical space while keeping selection controls accessible. Playwright regression `frontend/tests/project-cost-element-tabs.spec.ts` updated with EV legend assertion and collapsible visibility checks.

Comprehensive test coverage with proper relationships. Clean model organization with SQLModel patterns. Foundation established for Sprint 1.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection updated to use SQLite for MVP (was PostgreSQL). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite for initial implementation with clear migration path to PostgreSQL for production. Comprehensive selection document updated.
- **2024-12-19:** Technology stack selection completed (DOC-004). Selected FastAPI + React + SQLite (MVP). Comprehensive selection document created with rationale, architecture diagrams, and detailed component specifications.
- **2024-12-19:** Updated PRD and data model with Planned Value and Earned Value calculation requirements. Added Baseline Log table to replace boolean baseline flags with proper baseline_id references. All documentation is now complete and aligned.

### Design Decisions

- Technology stack: FastAPI (backend), React + TypeScript (frontend), PostgreSQL database
- **Model implementation approach:** Model-first with auto-generated Alembic migrations, using SQLModel throughout
- **TDD discipline:** Comprehensive test suite with 66 model tests covering relationships, validation, and schemas
- **Code organization:** Clean separation - 1 file per model with Base/Create/Update/Public schema pattern
- Baseline tracking uses centralized Baseline Log table instead of scattered boolean flags
- Planned Value calculation uses Cost Element Schedule with progression types (linear, gaussian, logarithmic)
- Earned Value calculation uses baselined percentage of work completed
- All baseline references use baseline_id for proper audit trail and historical tracking
- UUID primary keys throughout for scalability
- Comprehensive foreign key relationships with cascade deletes where appropriate

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** ✅ **Sprint 2 COMPLETE!** All Sprint 2 tasks implemented (E2-001, E2-002, E2-003, E2-005, E2-006) with E2-004 skipped for later
2. **Short-term:** Begin Sprint 3 tasks (Cost Registration, Cost History, Earned Value Recording)
3. **Medium-term:** Complete Sprint 3 and proceed to Sprint 4 (EVM Calculations)
