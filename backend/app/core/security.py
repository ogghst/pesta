# Patch passlib's bcrypt handler to handle wrap bug detection with bcrypt 4.x
# bcrypt 4.x has a 72-byte password limit that can cause issues during
# passlib's internal wrap bug detection. The _finalize_backend_mixin method
# calls detect_wrap_bug which tries to hash a 255-byte password, triggering
# bcrypt's 72-byte limit. This patch catches and handles the error gracefully.
