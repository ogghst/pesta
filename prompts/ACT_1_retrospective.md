RETROSPECTIVE: Continuous Improvement Analysis

Reflect on this coding session to improve future interactions:

1. SESSION SUMMARY
   - What was our objective?
   - What did we accomplish?
   - How long did it take?
   - What was the token usage?

2. CRITICAL MOMENTS ANALYSIS
   Identify 2-3 pivotal moments where:
   - Our approach significantly impacted success or failure
   - A decision or intervention changed the trajectory
   - We discovered something important about the problem
   
   For each moment:
   - What happened?
   - Why was it significant?
   - What did we learn?

3. COLLABORATION EFFECTIVENESS
   - What patterns in our interaction were most effective?
   - Where did communication break down or become inefficient?
   - What types of prompts or questions worked best?
   - Where did I (human) provide most value?

4. WASTED EFFORT ANALYSIS
   - Were there any wrong paths taken?
   - What could we have caught earlier?
   - What rework was needed and why?
   - What assumptions proved incorrect?

5. PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS
   - What would have accelerated our progress?
   - What process elements worked well?
   - What should we change in our workflow?
   - How could prompts be improved?

6. TECHNICAL INSIGHTS
   - What did we learn about the codebase?
   - What patterns should we remember for next time?
   - What risks or complexities did we uncover?

7. SINGLE MOST VALUABLE CHANGE
   If you could change ONE thing to improve our next session:
   - What would it be?
   - Why would it have the most impact?
   - How specifically should we implement it?

Be specific and actionable in your recommendations.
