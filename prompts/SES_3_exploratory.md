EXPLORATION SESSION

Goal: Understand [specific codebase area or problem space]
This is discovery, not implementation.

OBJECTIVES:
1. Map architectural patterns
2. Identify key abstractions
3. Understand data flow
4. Note testing approaches
5. Flag risks or complexity

DELIVERABLES:
- Architecture diagram or description
- Key files and their responsibilities
- Patterns and conventions observed
- Unknowns or areas needing clarification
- Recommendation for implementation approach

Time box: [X] minutes
